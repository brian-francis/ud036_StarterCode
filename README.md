# Fresh Tomatoes: Movie Trailer Website
My solution for the Fresh Tomatoes website as part of Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree.

## Dependencies
This project was built using Python 2.7. You can find the installer for your system [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## How to Run this Project
An HTML file is generated by running entertainment_center.py. To get started, please complete the following steps;

1. Verify that you have Python 2.7 installed on your system. Instructions for Mac and Windows 7 can be found [here](https://edu.google.com/openonline/course-builder/docs/1.10/set-up-course-builder/check-for-python.html).
2. Clone this respository using git.
3. In the terminal, run `python entertainment_center.py`

This will create an HTML file called "fresh_tomatoes.html" in the same directory as "entertainment_center.py" and open in your default browser.
